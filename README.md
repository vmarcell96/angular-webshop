# Angular Webshop

# Description

I recently started learning about angular, and I chose to build a webshop application for learning purposes. I gradually build it up as I acquire knowledge about this technology.
Currently the backend is mocked with an in memory web api, but later I want to use a .Net Core Rest Api with entity framework core. 

## Stack
- TypeScript
- Angular
- .Net Core
- C#

## Features
- CRUD operations on products

## Production build

Working on it.

## Run Locally
##### Prerequisites

- Node.js to run Angular frontend

Clone the project and navigate to the project folder

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:vmarcell96/angular-webshop.git
  cd .\angular-webshop
```

Starting frontend:
Navigate to the front-end's main directory:

```bash
  cd .\angular-webshop
```

Install packages

```bash
  npm i
```

Start the application 

```bash
  npm start
```
Client should be available at `localhost:4200`


## Roadmap

- User registration/log in
- Authentication/Authorization
- Creating back-end
- Implementing database
- Bugfix form validations on adding,editing products
